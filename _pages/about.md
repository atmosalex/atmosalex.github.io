Welcome to my home page. I am a postdoctoral researcher and instructor in the department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, UCLA, where I apply physics-based numerical modeling and machine learning methods to understand the distribution of protons and electrons in Earth's radiation belts. These particles irradiate orbiting satellites, leading to numerous adverse impacts, from degraded solar cell output power to total loss!

As an example of my research, I have been exploring the power of transformer-based neural networks, and recently used this architecture to develop a forecast of electron radiation belt phase space density. This model was trained using a cross-calibrated multi-spacecraft dataset that includes measurements from the NASA Van Allen Probes.

I am from the UK and hold a bachelor's degree in Geophysics and a master's degree in Physics from Imperial College London. I completed my [PhD in radiation belt physics](https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/532209/) at the British Antarctic Survey in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. In November 2022 I came to the US to begin my current job at UCLA.

In my spare time I enjoy exercise in various forms, tinkering with electronics and D&D. As pictured here, I am currently restoring my 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe K1500, which has involved carrying out major engine and drivetrain work, rebuilding the front steering and suspension, and much more!
