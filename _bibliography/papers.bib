abstract = {Abstract A large proton belt enhancement occurred on 24 March 1991 following an interplanetary shock that impacted the dayside magnetopause at \${\sim} \$03:40 UT. Its formation was measured by the proton telescope aboard CRRES and attributed to the injection and inward transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) by an azimuthally propagating electric field pulse induced by the shock's compression of the magnetosphere. This led to an increase in the flux of high energy ( \${ >} \$25 MeV) protons by several orders of magnitude at \$L\approx 2.5\$ which has been well-studied. However, a flux enhancement by up to one order of magnitude was also seen in 1–20 MeV protons at \$L\approx 2\$. Protons in this energy range pose a hazard to orbiting spacecraft as a major contributor to solar cell nonionizing dose. The 1–20 MeV enhancement cannot be explained by the inward transport of a solar proton source, because a newly injected source population at the required energy would have a drift velocity too low to interact with the pulse. Instead, we hypothesize that the 1–20 MeV enhancement was caused by the redistribution of radiation belt protons to different drift shells by the pulse. To test this hypothesis, we apply a novel method to predict the change in phase space density during a shock event which utilizes reverse-time particle tracing simulations. Our results show that the 1–20 MeV enhancement can be accounted for by internal redistribution as hypothesized. We thus identify a new mechanism for proton belt enhancements that does not depend on a SEP source and present a way to model it.},

abstract = {Abstract High energy resolution DEMETER satellite observations from the Instrument for the Detection of Particle (IDP) are analyzed during an electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC)-induced electron precipitation event. Analysis of an Interval Pulsation with Diminishing Periods (IPDP)-type EMIC wave event, using combined satellite observations to correct for incident proton contamination, detected an energy precipitation spectrum ranging from ∼150 keV to ∼1.5 MeV. While inconsistent with many theoretical predictions of >1 MeV EMIC-induced electron precipitation, the finding is consistent with an increasing number of experimentally observed events detected using lower resolution integral channel measurements on the POES, FIREBIRD, and ELFIN satellites. Revised and improved DEMETER differential energy fluxes, after correction for incident proton contamination shows that they agree to within 40\% in peak flux magnitude, and 85 keV (within 40\%) for the energy at which the peak occurred as calculated from POES integral channel electron precipitation measurements. This work shows that a subset of EMIC waves found close to the plasmapause, that is, IPDP-type rising tone events, can produce electron precipitation with peak energies substantially below 1 MeV. The rising tone features of IPDP EMIC waves, along with the association with the high cold plasma density regime, and the rapidly varying electron density gradients of the plasmapause may be an important factor in the generation of such low energy precipitation, co-incident with a high energy tail. Our work highlights the importance of undertaking proton contamination correction when using the high-resolution DEMETER particle measurements to investigate EMIC-driven electron precipitation.},

abstract = {Abstract The proton radiation belt contains high fluxes of adiabatically trapped protons varying in energy from ∼one to hundreds of megaelectron volts (MeV). At large radial distances, magnetospheric field lines become stretched on the nightside of Earth and exhibit a small radius of curvature RC near the equator. This leads protons to undergo field line curvature (FLC) scattering, whereby changes to the first adiabatic invariant accumulate as field strength becomes nonuniform across a gyroorbit. The outer boundary of the proton belt at a given energy corresponds to the range of magnetic L shell over which this transition to nonadiabatic motion takes place, and is sensitive to the occurrence of geomagnetic storms. In this work, we first find expressions for nightside equatorial RC and field strength Be as functions of Dst and L* to fit the TS04 field model. We then apply the Tu et al. (2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014ja019864) condition for nonadiabatic onset to solve the outer boundary L*, and refine our expression for RC to achieve agreement with Van Allen Probes observations of 1–50 MeV proton flux over the 2014–2018 era. Finally, we implement this nonadiabatic onset condition into the British Antarctic Survey proton belt model (BAS-PRO) to solve the temporal evolution of proton fluxes at L ≤ 4. Compared with observations, BAS-PRO reproduces storm losses due to FLC scattering, but there is a discrepancy in mid-2017 that suggests a ∼5 MeV proton source not accounted for. Our work sheds light on outer zone proton belt variability at 1–10 MeV and demonstrates a useful tool for real-time forecasting.},

abstract = {Abstract Geomagnetically trapped protons forming Earth's proton radiation belt pose a hazard to orbiting spacecraft. In particular, solar cell degradation is caused by non-ionising collisions with protons at energies of several megaelectron volts (MeV), which can shorten mission lifespan. Dynamic enhancements in trapped proton flux following solar energetic particle events have been observed to last several months, and there is a strong need for physics-based modeling to predict the impact on spacecraft. However, modeling proton belt variability at this energy is challenging because radial diffusion coefficients are not well constrained. We address this by using the British Antarctic Survey proton belt model BAS-PRO to perform 3D simulations of the proton belt in the region 1.15 ≤ L ≤ 2 from 2014 to 2018. The model is driven by measurements from the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment and Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer instruments carried by the Van Allen Probe satellites. To investigate sensitivity, simulations are repeated for three different sets of proton radial diffusion coefficients DLL taken from previous literature. Comparing the time evolution of each result, we find that solar cycle variability can drive up to a ∼75\% increase in 7.5 MeV flux at L = 1.3 over four years due to the increased importance of collisional loss at low energies. We also show how the anisotropy of proton pitch angle distributions varies with L and energy, depending on DLL. However we find that phase space density can vary by three orders of magnitude at L = 1.4 and μ = 20 MeV/G due to uncertainty in DLL, highlighting the need to better constrain proton DLL at low energy.},

abstract = {Abstract Proton flux measurements from the Proton Telescope instrument aboard the CRRES satellite are revisited, and used to drive a radial diffusion model of the inner proton belt at 1.1 ≤ L ≤ 1.65. Our model utilizes a physics-based evaluation of the cosmic ray albedo neutron decay (CRAND) source, and coulomb collisional loss is driven by a drift averaged density model combining results from the International Reference Ionosphere, NRLMSIS-00 atmosphere and Radio Plasma Imager plasmasphere models, parameterized by solar activity and season. We drive our model using time-averaged data at L = 1.65 to calculate steady state profiles of equatorial phase space density, and optimize our choice of radial diffusion coefficients based on four defining parameters to minimize the difference between model and data. This is first performed for a quiet period when the belt can be assumed to represent steady state. Additionally, we investigate fitting steady state solutions to time averages taken during active periods where the data exhibits limited deviation from steady state, demonstrated by CRRES measurements following the March 24, 1991 storm. We also discuss a way to make the optimization process more reliable by excluding periods of variability in plasmaspheric density from any time average. Lastly, we compare our resultant diffusion coefficients to those derived via a similar process in previous work, and diffusion coefficients derived for electrons from ground and in situ observations. We find that higher diffusion coefficients are derived compared with previous work, and suggest more work is required to derive proton diffusion coefficients for different geomagnetic activity levels.},

abstract = {Abstract The recent introduction of all-electric propulsion on geosynchronous satellites enables lower-cost access to space by replacing chemical propellant. However, the time period required to initially raise the satellite to geostationary orbit (GEO) is around 200 days. During this time the satellite can be exposed to dynamic increases in trapped flux, which are challenging to model. To understand the potential penalty of this new technique in terms of radiation exposure, the influence of several key parameters on solar cell degradation during the electric orbit raising period has been investigated. This is achieved by calculating the accumulation of nonionizing dose through time for a range of approaches. We demonstrate the changes in degradation caused by launching during a long-lived (hundreds of days) enhancement in megaelectron volt trapped proton flux for three different electric orbit raising scenarios and three different thicknesses of coverglass. Results show that launching in an active environment can increase solar cell degradation due to trapped protons by ∼5\% before start of service compared with a quiet environment. The crucial energy range for such enhancements in proton flux is 3–10 MeV (depending on shielding). Further changes of a few percent can occur between different trajectories, or when a 50-μm change in coverglass thickness is applied.},
